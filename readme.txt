Here is Hackenslash: A game Built In a Week, in its full ugly Python source-code glory.

To play the game, you MUST install Python 2.3 or higher, and the latest compatible version of PyGame. The simply run:
"python hackenslash.py" and enjoy.

You can get Python at www.python.org, and pygame at www.pygame.org


Should you wish to delve into the depths of the source code - I wish you the best of luck. This should not be construed in any manner as an example of how to right good code. This was whipped out under and extremely tight deadline with very little time to go back and comment, clean up, refactor, or even fix bugs. However, there may be some good ideas buried deep in there. Very deep. 

However, if you dare to go into this code and find something useful to use for your own project, I wish you the best of luck. Feel free to do so, under the terms of the license below - which basically says please acknowledge me in some small way so I can know I helped make you rich and famous.
